As it stands, I am well aware that this code is quite rough and not currently functional in it's incomplete state. I tried my best to limit myself to two hours as per the instructions, and did my best to add in as much of the basic logic as I could. Currently there is no database nor front end for this code to interact with, but I hope looking at the logic of the code written will provide a suitable demonstration of my abilities.

PS: I am also missing some imports, for which I apologize. My experience building a project from scratch is limited, and I thought my two hours were better used creating methods and demonstrating the logic rather than figuring out how to import everything properly. Given more time, I am confident I could sort these issues out.
